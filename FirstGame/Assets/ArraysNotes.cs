	// An Array is like a fence post. They vary in size but contain the same data type.
	// Arrays are numbered. Starting from 0. (0,1,2,3,4,5,...)
	// An Array and a list is a collection.
	// Don't forget the accessor. The "." to access certain codes or files.
	// Arrays cannot be changable ingame. A list can. The difference.
	//Lists are CHANGEABLE.
