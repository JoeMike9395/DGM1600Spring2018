public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour {}

// Function Declaration and a Call Function
// Data type (Variables) examples is class, void, string, int(whole number), and float(non-whole number).
// Function Declaration can be void Start() {STUFF}
// Call function can be Start(); inside a Function Declaration. Or used to call an audio (Or any) file.
// A box within a box within a box (Classes)
// Every box has to have a {} It must be closed to work.
// Public class is see through. Private class dunno.
// Every Function has to have a () after the desired function (void)
// Void is a type of function. It does work but gives nothing back.
// Anthony how much do you like McDonalds?

//if (TRUTH)
//RUN
// Very simple. IF the statement is true. It does stuff. ex. (Name == Frog)<-Clicked Frog.

// Else Clauses:
// if (true){
	//Run Code}
// {else
	//Run Code}
// = Assign Value
// == Check Equality
// != Check Unequality
// >=
// >
// <=
// <

// Shortened if and else statements that could work WITH ONE LINE is something like:
// public bool Key ? print("Yes it is true" : "No it's not true");

//If you have more than 2 statements. Then don't use If Else statements. They are for TRUE or FALSE.
//Otherwise use something called a switch.
